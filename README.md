<p align="center" style="margin-top: -10px; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">Open-sourced, community-funded analytics, historical database, and developer platform built for Augur. Built to be a unified service enabling easy statistics-backed analytics for the average user.</p>

# Overview

### The problem
As a relatively early-stage platform, Augur has garnered enthusiast usage and is beginning to approach a more user-centric environment through platforms like [Veil](https://veil.co) and [Reporters.Chat](https://reporters.chat/), which aim to simplify the process of using the platform, for the average user.

As it grows though, there are limited expansive analytics resources. While there are niche tools and other web platforms offering specific services (think [Predictions.Global](https://predictions.global/), [Crystal Ball Be](http://crystalball.be/stats/), etc.), there are currently no open-source platforms for analytics, statistics, historical reporting, etc.

### The solution
Augur.wiki is an open-source initative , which aims to build a unified platform for Augur statictics and analytics. In specific, the current plan of action is focused around building:

1. Simple analysis dashboards which display specific network statistics (things like sync data, unique addresses, open interest, finalized markets, etc.)
2. Reporting dashboards which show the latest trades to happen on the platform in live-time.
3. Historical dashboards which allow users to search through past markets with simple keywords, view historical decisions made by other users, and analyze the specific hour-by-hour analysis of each market.
4. GraphQL API to allow developers to easily integrate platform data into their own applications.
5. A clean, easy-to-use User Interface so that the average user is able to easily access the data they need.
6. Plus, a few other small features I'm currently experimenting with (things like cross-platform alerts that you can setup to trigger when market actions occur, etc). More on this in the upcoming weeks, as I work out platform specifics.
